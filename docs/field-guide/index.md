# Field Guide

This guide provides detailed information about the different types of variable sources classified by SCoPe, along with examples of bogus variability.

## Introduction

Classification of time-domain sources can be approached in many different ways. SCoPe uses a two-branch taxonomy (see [Coughlin et al. 2021, arXiv:2102.11304](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.11304.pdf)):

- **Phenomenological** classes describe *what the light curve looks like* — periodic, irregular, sinusoidal, sawtooth, eclipsing, etc. These can be assigned from photometry alone.
- **Ontological** classes describe *what the object physically is* — RR Lyrae, W UMa, Cepheid, CV, YSO, etc. These often require additional information beyond the light curve (colors, absolute magnitudes, spectral type, host environment).

In practice, **classes overlap**. A W UMa contact binary is simultaneously an eclipsing variable (phenomenological) and a non-accreting binary (ontological). An RR Lyrae ab is both a sawtooth variable and a pulsator. The field guide pages below describe both the observational signatures and the physical nature of each class where applicable.

### Using this guide

Each field guide page includes:

- **Classification and numbers**: where the class sits in the taxonomy hierarchy and how common it is
- **ZTF light curves**: example light curves generated from Kowalski
- **Light curve characteristics**: period range, amplitude, and morphology to look for
- **HR and sky diagrams**: where these objects fall in color-magnitude space and on the sky
- **References**: key papers for further reading
