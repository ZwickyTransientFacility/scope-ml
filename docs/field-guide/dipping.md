## Dipping Variables (dip)

Dipping variables are objects that exhibit transient fading events — decreases in brightness that are not caused by eclipses from a stellar companion. The fading is typically caused by obscuration from circumstellar material such as dust in a disk, warped inner disk edges, or dust clouds in the line of sight.

### Classification and numbers
- Supertypes
  - variable
  - irregular
- Occurrence rate: uncommon as a primary classification; most dippers are young stellar objects or evolved dusty systems

### Description
Dipping is distinguished from eclipsing by the mechanism and light curve morphology. Eclipses are caused by a companion star or planet passing in front of the primary, producing repeatable, symmetric dips at a fixed orbital period. Dipping, by contrast, arises from circumstellar dust or gas structures and tends to produce:

- **Irregular depths**: successive dips vary in depth, unlike the repeatable depths of eclipses
- **Asymmetric profiles**: ingress and egress may differ in duration
- **Variable recurrence**: dips may be quasi-periodic (if tied to orbital dust structures) or fully aperiodic

### Light curve characteristics
- Fading events ranging from a few percent to several magnitudes
- Timescales from hours to weeks (individual dips) or months to years (faders)
- Flat or mildly variable baseline between dipping events
- Color-dependent depth: dips caused by dust extinction are typically deeper in bluer bands
- May appear quasi-periodic if the obscuring material co-rotates with the star (quasi-periodic dippers)

### Astrophysical sources of dipping
- **AA Tau-type dippers**: warped inner disk edges co-rotating with the YSO, producing quasi-periodic dips on the stellar rotation period (typically 3-10 days)
- **Aperiodic dippers**: dust structures at varying disk radii causing random occultation events
- **UX Ori / UXOR variables**: Herbig Ae/Be stars with large (1-3 mag) fading episodes from circumstellar dust clouds
- **R Coronae Borealis stars**: carbon-rich evolved stars forming dust in their atmospheres, causing deep (up to 8 mag) irregular fading
- **Disintegrating planets**: rare cases of transiting rocky planets shedding dusty tails (e.g., KIC 12557548)

### Distinguishing dipping from eclipsing
| Feature | Eclipsing | Dipping |
|---------|-----------|---------|
| Cause | Companion star/planet | Circumstellar dust/gas |
| Depth consistency | Repeatable | Variable |
| Period | Strict orbital period | Quasi-periodic or aperiodic |
| Symmetry | Usually symmetric | Often asymmetric |
| Color dependence | Achromatic (stellar occultation) | Chromatic (dust reddening) |
