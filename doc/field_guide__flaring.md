## Flaring stars (flaring)

A flare star is a variable star that dramatically increases in brightness for minutes before returning to quiescence. Most flare stars are red dwarfs, while RS Canum Venaticorum variables (RS CVn) are also known to flare due to a companion star in the binary system.

#### Description
Flaring stars are easy to recognise by their dramatic increase in brightness from quiescent levels, rapidly returning to that same level shortly thereafter.

#### Light curve characteristics
- variable
- dramatic increases in brightness
