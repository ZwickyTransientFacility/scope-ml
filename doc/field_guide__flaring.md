## Flaring variables (flaring)

The phenomelogical classification of ``flaring`` is any kind of outbursting source, where a variable star (or binary system) dramatically increases in brightness for minutes to hours before returning to quiescence. Most flare stars are red dwarfs, while RS Canum Venaticorum variables (RS CVn) are also known to flare due to a companion star in the binary system. Other possible sources of flaring include dwarf novae, which arise from accretion disk activity in a cataclysmic variable star.

### Classification and numbers
- Supertypes
  - variable
- Occurrence rate: very common, for a given red dwarf, flares 10³¹ - 10³² ergs occur about once per day, and flares 10³³ - 10³⁴ ergs occur about once per 10-100 days.

#### Description
Flaring stars are easy to recognise by their increase in brightness from quiescent levels, rapidly returning to that same level shortly thereafter.

#### Light curve characteristics
- variable
- increase in brightness before returning to quiescence.
- amplitude: at the bright end, flares can be many magnitudes, while at the dim end, flare detection is limited by survey photometric precision.
