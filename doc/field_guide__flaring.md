## Flaring variables (flaring)

The phenomelogical classification of ``flaring`` is any kind of outbursting source, where a variable star (or binary system) dramatically increases in brightness for minutes to hours before returning to quiescence. Most flare stars are red dwarfs, while RS Canum Venaticorum variables (RS CVn) are also known to flare due to a companion star in the binary system. Other possible sources of flaring include dwarf novae which are increases in luminosity in the accretion disk of a cataclysmic variable star.

#### Description
Flaring stars are easy to recognise by their dramatic increase in brightness from quiescent levels, rapidly returning to that same level shortly thereafter.
