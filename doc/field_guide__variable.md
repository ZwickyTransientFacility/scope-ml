## Variable stars (variable)
Variable stars are objects whose brightness is varying at a statistically significant level.
ZTF has statistical measurements depend on magnitude: down to ~10 millimagnitudes for bright stars and >0.1 mag for objects near the detection limit.
Many astrophysical objects exhibit variable behavior, including periodic variables such as eclipsing binaries, pulsators, etc, and non-periodic variables such as AGN and YSOs.

### Classification and numbers

#### Description
Most stars are likely to be variable at some level. Therefore, variable is defined to be those varying at a statistically varying level, with millimagnitude to magnitude level variations.

#### Light curve characteristics
- amplitude: varies from survey precision to more than a magnitude
